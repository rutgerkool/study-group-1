# study-group-1
Implementing the first exercise of our study group. 

This application uses the initial steps provided in the meeting notes to set up a react project from scratch. I have decided to add `eslint` to the project to help with development. 

## Random User Generator
The application uses the API from the [Random User Generator](randomuser.me) to display data from random users with a user interface. 

## Running the application

The application can be run with the following command. 

```bash
npm start
```
